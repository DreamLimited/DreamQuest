All of this looks good, except perhaps the MOV Dance area.  Can you suggest an area we can use here as people descend deeper?
The story is that people start at Dream Hive.... then they wander downwards into a cave for self-discovery.
 
When they reach enlightenment, they come out of the cave and learn STEAM Education and move upwards towards projects that contribute to society in a path where they first learn STEAM, then social skills and eventually to the top where they can build full products and run entire companies.
 
Give suggestions for each stage that you think might need to be different.
 
Put all of this in a proper descending list, just as we did, but also give descriptions of what each area entails.
