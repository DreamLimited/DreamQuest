You'll learn change management and the importance of emerging technological advances.

## üåê Lingo Hive - Network Communications Connectivity
In the Lingo Hive, networking is paramount. This is where you'll learn the art of communication and collaboration, essential for the interconnected world of ANDROID Ops. It's a space where you can build and nurture relationships that will support the growth and scalability of your projects and teams. You'll also learn and participate in the broader sector of telecommunications to understand equipment, architecture, and strategies to bridge the gap between people around the world.  We immerse into the most popular languages that are needed in emerging technology. This involves the study of various computer languages such as Python, C#, C, HTML, Javascript, and more.  We also cover communication tactics and tools such as Agile Scrum training, Daily Stand Up training, Fiber Optic & Ethernet Network mapping, and the switches and operators that hold these together. Lastly, we cover sound architectural mapping to give literacy of the connected pieces and the solution architecture maps needed so that all parts of a company and community can properly communicate with each other. 

## üé® Design Hive - Media and Content Creation
The Design Hive is where you dive into artistic expression and channel this into frameworks for productivity and success with other artists, designers, and product creators. Content is king and here you invigorate your inner artist across a wide spectrum of expressions. Gain literacy in operational systems that are crafted with precision and creativity. This hive is about creating analog media, digital media, and generative AI media to bring ideas to life. Our hive consists of experts with experience working with Disney, Hollywood, and Silicon Valley product management. Immerse in the arts and create the blueprints for success in the operational world.

## üìù Note Hive - Research, Data Science, and Secretarial Skills
Dive into the Note Hive to find passion and the right recipe for proper research and analysis. We cover the Scientific Method here and really encourage a systematic approach to forming opinions, gathering data, and visualizing this data into easily readable formats.  We teach & use IGUANAs, which are Intelligent Guides Using Advanced Notebook Applications such as Jupyter Notebooks. These IGUANAs help you tell stories and enrich media with proper statistics and analysis.  We also cover sophisticated secreterial skills such as literacy in Robert's Rules, creating meeting minutes, organizing legalese, and all other facets of powerful note taking that whole the paperwork together of organizations.  Here, you can find passion for creating and holding together policies.  We also partner with technology to not only hold policy in place, but to give Artificial Intelligence notes and policies to run by, so your GPT has boundaries and predictable personas. This hive supports your quest for continuous improvement and informed decision-making, providing a foundation for the importance and breadth of notes in a modern world.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Developer Dojo - Optimization and System Refinement
Optimization takes center stage in the Developer Dojo where builders use the blueprints and research of the previous hives along with sophisticated communication tools and procedures to build and develop. It is here that you turn dreams into reality.  In this hive, members refine and perfect operational processes. With a focus on efficiency, productivity, and quality, the Developer Dojo is where your Androids features are improved and all the components are actually fused together.

This hive also adheres to security protocols, addresses QA, testing, and feedback sessions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Think Dojo - Implementation of Ideas
In the Think Dojo, implementation is key. Building an Android takes skills, but integrating and implementing the android or the new features of such a complex system into an even larger complex system requires expert skill and foresight to ensure a seamless integration into existing systems.  This hive is where plans get synchronized with reality or at least a staging area to replicate reality. We also look over the entire Android design and ensure all procedures are followed.  We address anomolies and conduct pattern recognition to find where previous policies may have failed us. Then, we work across the entire team to put new policies in place for the people, the paperwork of that policy, and eventually the system.  This hive stays hyperfocused on ensuring that ideas brougth forth and concepts on roadmaps are carried forward all the way through each phase and finally prepped for release. Here, you'll learn to execute optimized processes, leveraging automation and digital technologies. It's also where you'll gain the skills to train and support teams, ensuring a smooth transition and adoption of new systems.

## üåü Leader Hive - Delivery Done Right
At the pinnacle of the journey is the Leader Hive, dedicated to continuous delivery. A culture is created within all other teams by the leaders of this hive, where we focus on the frequency and stability of the entire system delievered.  The leaders ensure the culture of ANDROID Ops is respected and that all stages and policies are respected by all teams with the end goal of predictable deliveries as the main focus.
